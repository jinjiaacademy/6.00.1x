Problem 1
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained
in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. 
For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:

Number of vowels: 5

"""
Problem 2
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' 
occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your 
program should print

Number of times bob occurs is: 2
"""







"""
Problem 3
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which 
the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, 
if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh

In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, 
if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
